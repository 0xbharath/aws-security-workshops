                <td align="left">This workshop shows how you can use an IP-based machine learning algorithm with Amazon SageMaker to augment and enrich findings from AWS Security services such as Amazon GuardDuty. You'll learn how to load the notebook in SageMaker, train the model, and score findings to determine abnormality of the activity.</td>

                <td align="left">This hands-on workshop where you learn about a number of AWS services involved with threat detection and remediation as we walk through some real-world threat scenarios. Learn about the threat detection capabilities of Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, AWS Config, and the available remediation options. For each hands-on scenario, we review methods to remediate the threat using the following services: AWS CloudFormation, Amazon S3, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC flow logs, Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon SNS, Amazon Macie, DNS logs, AWS Lambda, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector and, of course, Amazon GuardDuty.</td>
