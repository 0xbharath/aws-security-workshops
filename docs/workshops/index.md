                <td align="left">This workshop shows how you can use an IP-based machine learning algorithm with Amazon SageMaker to augment and enrich findings from AWS Security services such as Amazon GuardDuty. You'll learn how to load the notebook in SageMaker, train the model, and score findings to determine abnormality of the activity.</td>

                <td align="left"> This hands-on workshop is where you will learn about a number of AWS services involved with threat detection and response as we walk through real-world threat scenarios. Learn about the threat detection capabilities of AWS services and the available response options. For each hands-on scenario, we review methods to detect and respond to threats using the following services: AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC flow logs, Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon Macie, AWS Lambda, Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub.</td>

                <td align="left">This workshop is composed of a series of rounds covering a range of identity and access management topics. These topics cover identity in general, not just the AWS IAM service. To that end you will find coverage for platform identity, application identity and infrastructure identity on AWS. Some of the services covered (this is not a complete list) include AWS IAM, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch Events, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon Macie, Amazon Inspector and Amazon GuardDuty. </td>
