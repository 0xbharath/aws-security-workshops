# AWS Security Workshops

Within AWS there are a variety of services that can be used to secure your environments and workloads running in the cloud. This repository contains a collection of security oriented workshops that will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks and give you hands on experience with a wide range of AWS services.  The workshops closely align with the [Security Perspective](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_CAF_Security_Perspective.pdf) components of our Cloud Adoption Framework, which can be used to help you structure your selection and implementation of controls that are right for your organziation.  Below is a visual representation that showcases where certain AWS security related services fall in each component.
