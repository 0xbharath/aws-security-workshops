# AWS Security Workshops

Within AWS there are a variety of services that can be used to secure your environments and workloads running in the cloud. This repository contains a collection of security oriented workshops that will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks and give you hands on experience with a wide range of AWS services.  The workshops closely align with the [Security Perspective](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_CAF_Security_Perspective.pdf) components of our Cloud Adoption Framework, which can be used to help you structure your selection and implementation of controls that are right for your organziation.  Below is a visual representation that showcases where certain AWS security related services fall in each component.

## Security Components

* **Identity** - Define, enforce, and audit user permissions across AWS services, actions and resources.

* **Detective Control** - Gain visibility to spot issues before they impact the business, improve your security posture, and reduce the risk profile of your environment.

* **Infrastructure Security** - Reduce the surface area to manage and increase privacy for and control of your overall infrastructure on AWS.

* **Data Protection** - In addition to our automatic data encryption and management services, employ more features for data protection.

* **Incident Response** - During an incident, containing the event and returning to a known good state are important elements of a response plan. AWS provides the following tools to automate aspects of this best practice.

## Workshops

> Please review and complete all Prerequisites before attempting these workshops.

- [**Threat Detection and Remediation**](https://code.amazon.com/packages/Aws-security-workshops/trees/mainline/--/threat-detection) - This workshop demonstrates how you can use AWS Security services such Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Macie to detect malicious and unauthorized threats in an environment. You'll learn how to setup detective controls in your environment, investigate a variety of findings, and put in place automated remediations using Lambda.

## Prerequisites

### AWS Account

In order to complete this workshop you'll need an AWS Account, and an AWS IAM user in that account with at Admin permissions.

> **Use Your Own Account**: The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one student is using a given AWS account at a time. If you try sharing an account with another student, you'll run into naming conflicts for certain resources. Use a personal account or create a new AWS account for this workshop rather than using an organizationâ€™s account to ensure you have full access to the necessary services and to ensure you do not leave behind any resources from the workshop.

### Browser

We recommend you use the latest version of Chrome or Firefox to complete this workshop.

### Text Editor

For any workshop module that requires use of the AWS Command Line Interface (see above), you also will need a **plain text** editor for writing scripts. Any editor that inserts Windows or other special characters potentially will cause scripts to fail.
