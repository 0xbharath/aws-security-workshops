# AWS Security Workshops

Within AWS there are a variety of services that can be used to secure your environments and workloads running in the cloud. This repository contains a collection of security oriented workshops that will guide you through prepared scenarios that represent common use cases and operational tasks and give you hands on experience with a wide range of AWS services.  The workshops closely align with the Security Perspective components of our Cloud Adoption Framework, which can be used to help you structure your selection and implementation of controls that are right for your organziation.  Below is a visual representation that showcases where certain AWS security related services fall in each component.
